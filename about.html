	<li><h9>Summary</h9><br></li>
	<h17>The Summer I Turned Pretty centers on Isabel "Belly" Conklin (Lola Tung), a teenager who spends three fateful summers at Cousins Beach, accompanied by her mom, Laurel (Jackie Chung), and older brother, Steven (Sean Kaufman). At Cousins, the Conklins vacation with Laurel’s best friend, Susannah Fisher (Rachel Blanchard), and her sons, Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) in their beach house. Belly’s spent years pining for Conrad, but he and Jeremiah both view her as Steven’s little sister, rather than a potential romantic partner. That is, until the summer Belly turns 16 and suddenly catches both brothers’ attention.<br>

That summer, Steven forgoes the beach to tour potential colleges, leaving his sister and Susannah’s sons to entertain themselves without him. Conrad and Jeremiah immediately notice how much Belly has grown up, as does another vacationer, Cam (David Iacono).<br>

After Cam becomes the first boy ever to tell Belly that’s she’s beautiful, the two strike up a summer romance, much to the Fisher brothers’ chagrin. Every time Belly and Cam have a chance at a romantic interlude, Conrad and Jeremiah crash their good time — and throw in some teasing, to boot. Eventually, Cam realizes that he’s more into Belly than Belly is into him. He breaks up with her, leaving Belly free to pursue her crush on Conrad once more.<br>
Something isn’t right with Conrad, however. He’s been moody all summer, and not just teenage-boy moody, either. Conrad’s behavior gives Jeremiah an opening to tell Belly how he feels: Jeremiah tries to convince her that he’d make a better boyfriend than his older brother, but his boldness only drives Belly toward Conrad.<br>

But when she finally confesses her feelings for Conrad, he rejects Belly, and Jeremiah confronts him, resulting in a fight between the two brothers.<br>

After Laurel breaks up the fight, we learn why Conrad has been acting funny all summer. As it turns out, Laurel and Susannah have spent the last few weeks sheltering their kids from a devastating secret: Susannah has cancer, and it’s probably fatal. Conrad and Jeremiah already figured it out, but no one’s told Belly until this climactic moment. The two little families spend their remaining weeks in the Fishers’ beach house trying to make the best of what could be their last summer together, and the book ends on a high note as Belly and Conrad get cozy through the winter.<br></h17>
